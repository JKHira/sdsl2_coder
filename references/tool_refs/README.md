# Tool Reference Index

This folder contains lightweight, reusable summaries of core logic extracted
from legacy tools. These notes are intended to be a stable reference for new
v2-only tooling.

- legacy_extractor_core.md: Deterministic tag/decl attribution + evidence extraction.
- gate_b1_b2_core.md: Canonical normalization + token/binding checks.
- gate_b3_deps_core.md: @Dep generation from ledger evidence only.
- gate_c_core.md: Finalizer checks + deterministic statement grouping.
